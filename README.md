# OOP_Coffee_Machine

Re-Engineered Initial Procedural Coffee Machine program using concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
Distribution of Project into Class and Methods is implemented. 
Use of Objects is done in main.py file to create the final working of coffee machine.

Basically main.py acts as brain of program and other files perform the tasks/operations associated with them.
